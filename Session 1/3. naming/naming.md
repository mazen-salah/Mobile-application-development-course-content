In Java, naming conventions play a crucial role in writing clean and readable code. Here are some common naming conventions in Java:

1. Class Names: Class names should be written in CamelCase, starting with an uppercase letter. For example, `MyClass`, `EmployeeDetails`.
2. Method Names: Method names should also be written in CamelCase, starting with a lowercase letter. For example, `calculateTotal`, `getUserDetails`.
3. Variable Names: Variable names should be written in camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter. For example, `firstName`, `age`.
4. Constants: Constants should be written in uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores. For example, `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`.
5. Package Names: Package names should be written in lowercase letters, with words separated by dots. For example, `com.example.myproject`.
6. Boolean Variables: Boolean variables should be named with a prefix that implies a question. For example, `isReady`, `hasPermission`.

In addition to naming conventions, it's important to be aware of reserved words in Java. Reserved words are words that have a special meaning in the programming language and cannot be used as identifiers. Some examples of reserved words in Java include `int`, `boolean`, `if`, `for`, and `while`.

Remember, following consistent naming conventions and avoiding the use of reserved words improves code readability and maintainability. Happy coding!
