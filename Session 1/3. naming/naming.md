In Java, naming conventions play a crucial role in writing clean and readable code. Here are some common naming convictions in Java:

1. Class Names: Class names should be written in CamelCase, starting with an uppercase letter. For example, `MyClass`, `EmployeeDetails`.

2. Method Names: Method names should also be written in CamelCase, starting with a lowercase letter. For example, `calculateTotal`, `getUserDetails`.

3. Variable Names: Variable names should be written in camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter. For example, `firstName`, `age`.

4. Constants: Constants should be written in uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores. For example, `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`.

5. Package Names: Package names should be written in lowercase letters, with words separated by dots. For example, `com.example.myproject`.

6. Boolean Variables: Boolean variables should be named with a prefix that implies a question. For example, `isReady`, `hasPermission`.

Remember, following consistent naming conventions improves code readability and maintainability. Happy coding!
