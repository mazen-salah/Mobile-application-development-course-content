Tasks
1. Create a simple calculator program that prompts the user to enter two numbers. The program should then calculate and display the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers.

2. Develop a console application to collect faculty data from students. The application should prompt the user to enter the faculty name, last grade, last degree, number of subjects, and whether the student passed or not.

Note: To take input in Java, you can use the `Scanner` class. Here's an example of how to use it:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String text = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        System.out.println("Text: " + text);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. We can use methods like `nextInt()` to read an integer, `nextLine()` to read a string, and so on. Remember to close the `Scanner` object after you're done reading input to free up system resources.
