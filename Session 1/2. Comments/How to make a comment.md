To make a single-line comment in Java, you can use the double forward slash (`//`) followed by your comment. For example:

```java
// This is a single-line comment
```

To make a multi-line comment in Java, you can use the forward slash and asterisk (`/*`) to start the comment, and the asterisk and forward slash (`*/`) to end the comment. For example:

```java
/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
```
