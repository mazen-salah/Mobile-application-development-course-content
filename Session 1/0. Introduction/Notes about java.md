# Introduction

## Language Types

### Machine Language

- Machine language is the lowest level of programming language understood by computers. It consists of binary code (0s and 1s) that directly represents instructions and data. Each computer architecture has its own specific machine language.

### Low-Level Languages

- Low-level languages are programming languages that are closer to machine language. They provide a more direct control over the hardware and are less abstracted. Examples of low-level languages include assembly language and machine language.

#### Assembly Language (ASM)

- Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions. It is specific to a particular computer architecture. Assembly language programs are translated into machine code using an assembler.

### High-Level Languages

- High-level languages are programming languages that are more human-readable and easier to understand than low-level languages. They are designed to be closer to natural language and provide higher-level abstractions. Examples of high-level languages include Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

#### Java

- Java is a high-level programming language that is platform-independent. It was designed to be portable and run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed by the JVM. The Java platform consists of the JVM, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Development Kit (JDK).

##### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- The JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides a runtime environment for Java programs to run on different platforms. The JVM handles memory management, garbage collection, and other runtime tasks.

##### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- The JRE is a software package that includes the JVM and other libraries required to run Java applications. It provides the necessary runtime environment for executing Java programs.

##### JDK (Java Development Kit)

- The JDK is a software development kit that includes tools for developing, debugging, and compiling Java applications. It includes the JRE, compiler, debugger, and other development tools.
