# Introduction

## Language Types

### Machine Language

- Machine language is the lowest level of programming language understood by computers.
- It consists of binary code (0s and 1s) that directly represents instructions and data.
- Each computer architecture has its own specific machine language.

### Low-Level Languages

- Low-level languages are programming languages that are closer to machine language.
- They provide a more direct control over the hardware and are less abstracted.
- Examples of low-level languages include assembly language and machine language.

#### Assembly Language (ASM)

- Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions.
- It is specific to a particular computer architecture.
- Assembly language programs are translated into machine code using an assembler.

### High-Level Languages

- High-level languages are programming languages that are more human-readable and easier to understand than low-level languages.
- They are designed to be closer to natural language and provide higher-level abstractions.
- Examples of high-level languages include Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

#### Java

- Java is a high-level programming language that is platform-independent.
- It was designed to be portable and run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed by the JVM.
- The Java platform consists of the JVM, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Development Kit (JDK).

##### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- The JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.
- It provides a runtime environment for Java programs to run on different platforms.
- The JVM handles memory management, garbage collection, and other runtime tasks.

##### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- The JRE is a software package that includes the JVM and other libraries required to run Java applications.
- It provides the necessary runtime environment for executing Java programs.

##### JDK (Java Development Kit)

- The JDK is a software development kit that includes tools for developing, debugging, and compiling Java applications.
- It includes the JRE, compiler, debugger, and other development tools.
