# Data Types in Java

In Java, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. Java has two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types.

## Primitive Data Types

Java has eight primitive data types:

1. **byte**: Used to store whole numbers from -128 to 127.
2. **short**: Used to store whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767.
3. **int**: Used to store whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
4. **long**: Used to store whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
5. **float**: Used to store decimal numbers with single precision.
6. **double**: Used to store decimal numbers with double precision.
7. **boolean**: Used to store either true or false.
8. **char**: Used to store a single character.

## Reference Data Types

Reference data types are used to refer to objects. They include classes, interfaces, arrays, and enumerations. Unlike primitive data types, reference data types don't store the actual data, but rather a reference to the memory location where the data is stored.

Examples of reference data types in Java include:

- **String**: Used to store a sequence of characters.
- **Array**: Used to store multiple values of the same type.
- **Class**: Used to define a blueprint for creating objects.
- **Interface**: Used to define a contract for classes to implement.
- **Enumeration**: Used to define a set of named constants.

It's important to choose the appropriate data type based on the requirements of your program to ensure efficient memory usage and accurate data representation.
