To run code from the terminal using `javac` and `java`, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Java source code file is located using the `cd` command. For example, if your file is in the `src` folder, you can use `cd src`.
3. Compile your Java source code file using the `javac` command followed by the name of your file. For example, if your file is named `MyProgram.java`, you would run `javac MyProgram.java`. This will generate a bytecode file with a `.class` extension.
4. Once the compilation is successful, you can run your program using the `java` command followed by the name of the class containing the `main` method. For example, if your class is named `MyProgram`, you would run `java MyProgram`.
5. The program will now execute and display the output in the terminal.

Note: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system and the `javac` and `java` commands are accessible from the terminal.
