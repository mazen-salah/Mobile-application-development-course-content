# Lab 4

Write a program that prompts the user to input two arrays of integers, and concatenates them.

Implement a program that prompts the user to enter a string, and then divides it into separate words based on spaces. For example, if the user enters "My name is Ahmed", the program should print each word on a new line:

My
Name
Is
Ahmed
