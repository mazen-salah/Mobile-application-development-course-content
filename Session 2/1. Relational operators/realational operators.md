Relational operators are used in programming languages to compare values and determine the relationship between them. These operators are commonly used in conditional statements and loops to make decisions based on the comparison results.

Some commonly used relational operators include:

- Equal to (==): This operator checks if two values are equal and returns true if they are, and false otherwise.
- Not equal to (!=): This operator checks if two values are not equal and returns true if they are not, and false otherwise.
- Greater than (>): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
- Less than (<): This operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
- Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
- Less than or equal to (<=): This operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.

Relational operators are essential for making logical comparisons in programming and are widely used in various applications. They help in controlling the flow of execution based on specific conditions, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive programs.
