Boolean Operators in Java

Boolean operators in Java are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. There are three main boolean operators in Java: AND, OR, and NOT.

1. AND Operator (&&):
The AND operator returns true if both operands are true, otherwise it returns false. It is represented by the symbol "&&". For example:
```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
boolean result = a && b; // result will be false
```

2. OR Operator (||):
The OR operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise it returns false. It is represented by the symbol "||". For example:
```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
boolean result = a || b; // result will be true
```

3. NOT Operator (!):
The NOT operator is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the NOT operator will make it false, and vice versa. It is represented by the symbol "!". For example:
```java
boolean a = true;
boolean result = !a; // result will be false
```

These boolean operators are commonly used in conditional statements, loops, and other logical operations in Java programming.
